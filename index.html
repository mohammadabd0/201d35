            To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee.
            It was published in 1960 and was instantly successful. In the United
            States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To
            Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American
            literature, winning the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are
            loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and
            an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in
            1936, when she was ten. Despite dealing with the serious issues of
            rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and
            humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral
            hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The
            historian Joseph Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, To
            Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing
            with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the
            most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."[1] As a Southern
            Gothic and Bildungsroman novel, the primary themes of To Kill a
            Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of
            innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of
            class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. The
            book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons
            that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes,
            To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from
            public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets.
            In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as
            one "every adult should read before they die".[3] Reaction to the
            novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies
            sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is
            sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual
            impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public
            figures, calls the book "an astonishing phenomenon".[4] It was
            adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director
            Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a
            play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's
            hometown. To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only published book until
            Go Set a Watchman, an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was
            published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's
            impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused
            any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.

            Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was
            first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review
            from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety
            in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday.
            It is considered one of the most important works of modernist
            literature[1] and has been called "a demonstration and summation of
            the entire movement."[2] According to Declan Kiberd, "Before Joyce,
            no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of
            thinking".[3] Ulysses chronicles the appointments and encounters of
            the itinerant Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary
            day, 16 June 1904.[4][5] Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus,
            the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes
            a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with
            structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of
            Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus
            and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early
            20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's
            relationship to Britain. The novel is highly allusive and also
            imitates the styles of different periods of English literature.
            Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and
            scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in
            1921 to protracted textual "Joyce Wars". The novel's stream of
            consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental
            prose—replete with puns, parodies, and allusions—as well as its rich
            characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one
            of the greatest literary works in history; Joyce fans worldwide now
            celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.
